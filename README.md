# k-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm-and-Nested-Cross-Validation

This repository contains a custom implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm and Nested Cross-Validation (NCV) for a Machine Learning project using the wine dataset. The main objectives are to demonstrate understanding of common Python ML techniques and gain practical experience in implementing ML methods and evaluating their performance.

## Project Components:
- Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset and answer related questions.
- kNN Implementation: Implement the kNN algorithm without using pre-built libraries.
- Evaluation & NCV: Implement nested cross-validation to evaluate the kNN algorithm.
- Results & Analysis: Present results, summary, and confusion matrices.
- Final Questions: Answer questions related to the project.
